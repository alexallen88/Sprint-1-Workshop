# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
It's a more basic form of a GUI - Graphical User Interface. You can locate files and also see what's in them using the cat command. You can also upload and download files from github using various commands. 


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?



### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do
The git branch command can be used to create a new branch. git checkout -b

cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

ls - lists the files

cd - changes directory or cd .. goes up another layer/jumps out

git clone git@github.com: - copies a repository onto your computer

touch – creates a file on your computer

### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?



### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?



### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I immediately wanted to ask a tutor or figure out the problem instantly. Then I read over the error message Git Bash gave me and copied the message it has suggested which was my e-mail. I think it was when I was first trying to push something onto github. I also read someone’s message on the slack page about a similar issue.


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

It takes time solving problems. The Technical Support diploma I completed this year has helped a little. Previously I might have skipped the problem. It’s challenging trying to figure out what to do without clear instructions sometimes.  


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?



### Why create a Branch?



### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  



# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?




### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?





# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?



### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?





# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
Googling hopefully solves it. If not looking at the slack page might be useful because other students have probably encountered the same problem. I’d message a tutor for the last resort.  




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
I was a bit nervous, it’s also a bit different doing it online. 


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
Yeah I was self-conscious and didn’t want to talk about myself for too long.
